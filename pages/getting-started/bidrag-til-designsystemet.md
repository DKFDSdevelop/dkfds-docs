lead: Users of the U.S. Web Design Standards have created implementations for
  popular content management systems, web frameworks, and package managers that
  may help get you started more quickly and easily. Though some implementations
  may not include all of the Standards, they should give your team a strong
  foundation to work from.

* The implementation’s target language and/or framework
* The author’s name (or alias) and contact URL or email address
* The most recent [version]({{ site.baseurl }}/whats-new/releases/) of the Standards that the project targets
* Any useful caveats or other notes
