lead: These templates for a landing page and a documentation page are built from some of the components of the U.S. Web Design Standards. Each of these pages is flexible; you can add or remove components or sub-components to suit your needs. These templates are great starting point for prototyping or for trying the Standards to see if theyâ€™re a good fit for you.
